    The entire mergedplayer file exists to flatten individual stats in the db
    into two numbers (per name). So normally the db is:
    hps_db.dp[mob_name][player_name] = {stats}
    Mergedplayer iterates over mob_name and returns a table that's just:
    tab[player_name] = {CalculatedStatA,CalculatedStatB}

           "MergedPlayer constructor requires at least one Player instance.")

    setmetatable(o, self)
    self.__index = self

    return o
